A script testing an rpg style combat system for text-based games.

The system is influenced by old Pokemon games and Undertale.

Download the repo, run `python3 fight-turn-based.py` and enjoy.

You can play `fight.py` as well, but it's the original and is not turn based nor that fun.

Visit the tutorial in the Wiki to get a good idea of how to play. It's also accessible via the game.
